## Mecanum Screw: An omnidirectional vehicle

### Abstract

This paper introduces an omnidirectional all-terrain robot,made of a fusion between screw-drive and mecanum wheels. The vehicleis designed to operate on flat surfaces as well as on various uneven softground such as mud or snow. The project inspirations have been fed withmany existing vehicles that focus on one or the other mechanism and thatknowledge has been used to address specific design challenges. Yet, uponreviewing the field, it appears that the proposed design is unique and isnot patented. The research phase consists of several prototype proposalswith  the  aim  of  maximizing  efficiency  and  easy  of  construction.  Thispaper discusses the different prototypes with respect to tests and resultsbut also suggests future improvements to the design.

### Introduction

This project consists of the implementation of a vehicle with a screw-drive andmecanum wheel fusion. The aim that the robot should be capable of operatingon flat and planar surfaces, with mecanum wheels allowing the robot to moveeasily in all directions. Whilst, the screw propelled vehicle mechanism is usefulto deal with harsh terrain in extreme environments (i.e. recovering cosmonautsin Russia, ground surveying. . . ). This section gives a brief chronology of bothmechanisms and introduces few research papers that served as the starting pointfor the project.
