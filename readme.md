This project represent the fusion of two parts: a Mecanum wheel and a screw propeller.
Why fusing those ? Because a Mecanum wheel allow an omnidirectional control of a vehicle on Hard ground (concrete...)but not on soft ground(mud, sand ...), as rock, earth ... could block the wheels, while it is the opposite for the screw propeller.
It works well on soft ground, and even water, but it's blade could break or deteriorate the road if it was used on hard ground.
As such fusing both would provide an all-terrain vehicle using both world.
In this repertory, you will find the different videos of testing realized, images on the designs, the differents Designs realized on Fusion 360, the STL files ready to be printed and finally the code that would have been used if not for the Covid-19 pandemic.
